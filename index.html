			 	 <p>We strive to connect local innovators of color with a directory of resources and a community of peers.</p>

				<p>We've listed a few of our community core values below:</p>
			   	
			  	<!–– Core Values ––>

				<h3>
				<a id="build-things-that-matter" class="anchor" href="#build-things-that-matter" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Build Things that Matter</h3>

				<p>We believe anything worth the investment requires the cultivation of an effective product design process, stakeholder engagement, and should create meaningful solutions, and strategic value for each community the end-product comes in contact with. </p>

				<p>Great people, great products, and great organizations are the result of well managed resources, funding, and human capital investment. In order for this network to provide any value to you, we want connect you with the guidance, funding, and resources you need to make meaningful progress toward your goals. </p>

				<p>Not sure what those goals look like, or how to even get started? </p>

				<p>We've got great tools at our disposal to help you clarify your vision.</p>

				<h3>
				<a id="add-value" class="anchor" href="#add-value" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Add Value.</h3>

				<p>We believe that one of the best ways local leaders of color can become 'the most interesting person in the room' is by actively taking an interest in the contributions of others. </p>

				<p>At the Nerds of Color Network, we understand the profound impact that mentorship and peer relationships can make in the personal and professional development of another human being's life. As a result, we make an effort to encourage and promote the efforts of those who take the time to </p>

				<ul>
				<li>show up and offer support toward </li>
				<li>contribute toward the development of </li>
				<li>cultivate effective mentorship practices for</li>
				<li>create growth and development opportunities for</li>

				<a id="co-create-healthy-communities" class="anchor" href="#co-create-healthy-communities" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Co-Create Healthy Communities</h3>

				<p>As local leaders of color, we understand that we live in a socio-political climate which can pull our attention in many different directions. Addressing the unanticipated needs of our families and communities may, at times, feel as if we're being distracted from our goals and can create stress -- even in cases where these disruptions may still need to be addressed. This may add additional work to our schedules, and even potentially putg undesired strain on our physical and psychological health. </p>

				<p>Our goal is to create a space where you can find the resources and support you need to attend to your personal and professional needs -- in ways that enhance, rather than jeopardize your personal and professional health. We offer tools to help you not only make sense of challenges you may be facing, but also the practical steps you will need to navigate these challenges in ways that promote healthy decision making, self care, and healthy relationships.</p>
