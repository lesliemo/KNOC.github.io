<p>We strive to connect local leaders of color with a community of peers that is actively engaged in forming communities around interesting projects.</p>

<p>We've listed a few of our community core values below:</p>

<p>We believe anything worth investing in requires an active commitment toward its development process. </p>

<p>Great people, great products, and great organizations are the result of well managed resources, funding, and human capital investment. In order for this network to provide any value to you, we want connect you with the guidance, funding, and resources you need to make meaningful progress toward your goals. </p>

<p>Not sure what those goals look like, or how to even get started? </p>

<p>We've got great tools at our disposal to help you shape and clarify your vision.</p>

<h3>
<a id="add-value" class="anchor" href="#add-value" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Add Value.</h3>

<p>We believe that one of the best ways local leaders of color can become 'the most interesting person in the room' is by actively taking an interest in the contributions of others. </p>

<p>At the Nerds of Color Network, we understand the profound impact a mentorship and peer relationships can make in the personal and professional development of another human being's life. As a result, we make an effort to encourage and promote the efforts of those who take the time to </p>

<ul>
<li>show up and be present toward</li>
<li>offer encouragement to</li>
<li>cultivate effective mentorship practices for</li>
<li>create growth and development opportunities for</li>
</ul>

<p>other local leaders of color and the communities we partner with.</p>

<h3>
<a id="co-create-healthy-communities" class="anchor" href="#co-create-healthy-communities" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Co-Create Healthy Communities</h3>

<p>As local leaders of color, we understand that we live in a socio-political climate which can pull our attention in many different directions. Addressing unanticipated needs of our families and communities, may at times feel as if we're being distracted from our goals, but may be necessary to address -- adding additional work to our schedules, and even potentially putting undesired strain on our physical and psychological health. </p>

<p>Our goal is to create a space where you can find the resources and support you need to attend to your personal and professional needs in ways that enhance, rather than jeopardize your personal and professional health. We offer tools to help you not only make sense of challenges you may be facing, but also the practical steps you will need to navigate these challenges in ways that promote healthy decision making, self care, and healthy relationships.</p>
