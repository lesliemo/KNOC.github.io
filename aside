				<a id="co-create-healthy-communities" class="anchor" href="#co-create-healthy-communities" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Co-Create Healthy Communities</h3>

				<p>As local leaders of color, we understand that we live in a socio-political climate which can pull our attention in many different directions. Addressing the unanticipated needs of our families and communities may, at times, feel as if we're being distracted from our goals and can create stress -- even in cases where these disruptions may still need to be addressed. This may add additional work to our schedules, and even potentially putg undesired strain on our physical and psychological health. </p>

				<p>Our goal is to create a space where you can find the resources and support you need to attend to your personal and professional needs -- in ways that enhance, rather than jeopardize your personal and professional health. We offer tools to help you not only make sense of challenges you may be facing, but also the practical steps you will need to navigate these challenges in ways that promote healthy decision making, self care, and healthy relationships.</p>
